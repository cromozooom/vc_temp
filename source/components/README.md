# Components folder
Create sub folders here for components/modules created. Any Sass or Coffeescript files placed in the directories will be compiled and concatenated to the master style.css or app.js file upon saved.

Note: Make sure you add the `.sass/.scss` paths to the main stylesheet located in `/styles` or it won't be included.
